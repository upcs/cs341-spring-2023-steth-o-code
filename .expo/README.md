> Why do I have a folder named ".expo" in my project?

The ".expo" folder is created when an Expo project is started using "expo start" command.

> What does the "packager-info.json" file contain?

The "packager-info.json" file contains port numbers and process PIDs that are used to serve the application to the mobile device/simulator.

> What does the "settings.json" file contain?

The "settings.json" file contains the server configuration that is used to serve the application manifest.

> Should I commit the ".expo" folder?

No, you should not share the ".expo" folder. It does not contain any information that is relevant for other developers working on the project, it is specific to your machine.

Upon project creation, the ".expo" folder is already added to your ".gitignore" file.

> In the screens folder, the Login.js folder will be completely commented out. This is the login page. We left it in for future dev teams in order to add login functionality if wanted. On the initial push to the app store this page was removed to see if we can get it approved. 

Other references to the login folder will also be commented out in additional files.

What follows is a textual description of the app’s state.
Upon launch of the app, the user is greeted with the Main Menu page. Each button is clickable and leads to a separate screen of content.
Clicking the hamburger menu in the top left corner leads to the Sidebar Menu, where, again, each item is clickable and leads to a separate screen of content. Tapping outside the bounds of the sidebar brings you back to the screen you were interacting with before accessing the sidebar.
As stated before, each button leads to a screen of content. In the dropbox, we’ve supplied images of each style of screen, described as follows:
TOPICS
TUTORIAL
Leads to a poorly formatted (but functional) page with information and styling similar to a textbook
Multimedia: 
links currently lead to the development environment. We do not want this in the final version, as it is a big security issue. To investigate, look into the sql server or the php file that controls that screen
LECTURES
Red buttons are clickable, lead to pages that hold walkthrough videos
Videos are playable, though very small on the page. When clicked, they move to fill the screen
BOOKS
Clicking on a book’s icon leads to the amazon page for the book’s purchase
Our Team:
Fully functional
ABOUT US
My (Am’s) nemesis
Formatted in a way that has all the text in a column, but the images don’t adjust to fit the screen
QUIZ YOURSELF (Sidebar Access Only):
Clicking on the number of questions field scrolls you to the bottom of the page. Annoying
Quiz bit is functional and intuitive
DONATE (Sidebar Access Only):
Semi functional: PayPal connection functional, but the page stays in the state you left it, which is a security issue
No clear way to reset or go back
User Settings Widget:
Found by clicking on the gear image next to your username
Changing your name affects nothing on the rest of the app, with the exception of the username field, which saves your changes
